## Game Logic
The program operates in a while(1) loop. Snake body position tracked in an array. First checks for collision with food. Loops through the playing field, coloring blocks based on the blockâ€™s status (snake, food, background). Checks for head/body collision updates snake body. Runs on with a for loop delay to provide pacing and check for user input.
